## Hi, I'm Venkatesh — Bioinformatician | Genomics Researcher | Aspiring PhD Candidate

I hold a Master's in Technology in Bioinformatics and currently work as a Bioinformatician in the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.  
My research sits at the intersection of clinical microbiology, pathogen genomics, and machine learning. I specialize in large-scale bacterial genome analysis, focusing on **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**, **virulence profiling**, and **host-pathogen interactions**.

---

### What I’m Currently Working On
- **Hypervirulent _E. coli_ classification** using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), clustering, and expert-guided labeling.
- **Pathogen genomics pipelines** with Snakemake for automated analysis.
- **_Helicobacter pylori_ disease classification** using machine learning, integrating phylogeographic, genomic, and host metadata (age, sex, location).
- **SNP mining in clinically relevant genes** and preparing ML-ready feature sets from variant data (VCFs).

---

### Interests & Goals
- **Machine learning in microbial genomics**
- **Genomic epidemiology** and pathogen surveillance
- **AMR and virulence gene detection in large datasets**
- **PhD** applications in computational biology, microbial genomics, or translational bioinformatics
- Developing **scalable and reproducible pipelines** for pathogen analysis
